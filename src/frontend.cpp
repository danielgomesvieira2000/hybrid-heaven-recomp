// See include/hh/frontend.h for what this is and why it is optional. Copied
// from Wave Race 64: Recompiled's src/frontend.cpp; what is left out is Wave
// Race's own (its water, music, draw-distance and field-of-view options, and the
// display-list rewriter), and what is added is from Pilotwings 64's and Rayman
// 2's copies of the same file (the bindings written on first run and on exit,
// and HH_AUTOSTART).
//
// The division of labour is worth stating, because almost none of it is ours.
// RecompFrontend owns the launcher, the native file dialog, the ROM validation
// error messages, the settings tabs, the controller remapping and the profiles
// that persist between sessions. What a port supplies is three things: which
// game this is, what the menu entries should say, and a stylesheet.
