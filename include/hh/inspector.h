// The HUD inspector: point at an element, see what the port thinks it is, and
// change its class while the game is in front of you.
//
// Copied from Wave Race 64: Recompiled. There the widescreen 2D layer is decided
// by a classifier that runs over every display list, and before this panel the
// only way to see what it decided was to read a trace afterwards and match it to
// a screenshot by eye. A menu wipe lasts six tenths of a second, and an element's
// identity is not something a picture shows: several confident conclusions drawn
// that way were about the wrong frame (playbook 08).
//
// So the classifier publishes what it decided, every frame, and RT64's developer
// UI draws it: a list of the frame's elements with their identity, extent,
// projection and class, each with a dropdown that overrides the class on the
// next frame. RT64 supplies the rest -- it can pause the game and keep the paused
// frame interactive, and right-clicking a pixel lists the draw calls under it.
//
// In Hybrid Heaven the panel exists from phase 06 and the classifier that feeds
// it arrives with widescreen in phase 07 (docs/PLAN.md D11). It is on in every
// build and opened with F1; HH_INSPECTOR=0 removes the port's panel for an A/B,
// leaving RT64's own debug menu.
//
// Two threads meet here. The classifier runs on the thread that submits display
// lists and fills a frame under construction; the panel runs on the thread that
// owns the renderer's UI and reads the last frame that was completed. They swap
// under a lock, once per frame.
