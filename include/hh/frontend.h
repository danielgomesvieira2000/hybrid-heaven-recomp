// The launcher, ROM picker and config menu, from RecompFrontend.
//
// Everything here is what every N64: Recompiled port needs and none of it is
// specific to Hybrid Heaven: a first-run flow that asks the player for their own
// dump and validates it, a settings menu, and rebindable input with per-device
// controller profiles. RecompFrontend implements all of it; this file is the
// small amount of wiring that tells it which game it is looking at. Copied from
// Wave Race 64: Recompiled (docs/PLAN.md, phase 06).
//
// It is compiled only when HH_WITH_FRONTEND is on. Without it the port keeps
// the phase 03 behaviour of taking a ROM path on the command line.
